Note 3 things:
1. fill with garbage until we get to heap location, where img_tag string data is stored (128 bytes)
2. very interesting: gor (in the exploit file) becomes got in the DOM: the code for some reason increments this value twice and thus changes the ASCII character from r -> t
3. badchars: \t, \n, and space, that's why we use &nbsp;
