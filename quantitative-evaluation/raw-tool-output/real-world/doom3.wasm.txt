  benchmark: d3demo
  binary:    d3wasm.wasm

Functions:      8239
  Imported:      291
  Non-imported: 7948
  Exported:       95

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:      5065
  Of those, unique functions: 4449 (i.e., at least 54.00% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:   1735381
  call:           39337 (2.27% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:  17903 (1.03% of all, 31.28% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 20519824
     2781 × global.get   5640 × global.set   8421 total (33/67% split)
  #1 i32
     init: i32.const 0
     3138 × global.get      4 × global.set   3142 total (100/0% split)
  #2 i32
     init: i32.const 0
      716 × global.get      2 × global.set    718 total (100/0% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer: 2780 (34.98% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
