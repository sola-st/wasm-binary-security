Functions:        73
  Imported:        0
  Non-imported:   73
  Exported:        4

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:        24
  Of those, unique functions:   17 (i.e., at least 23.29% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:    111437
  call:            5891 (5.29% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:     34 (0.03% of all, 0.57% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 1048576
     29 × global.get   48 × global.set   77 total (38/62% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:   29 (39.73% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
