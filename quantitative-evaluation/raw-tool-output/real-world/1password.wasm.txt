  binary:    dac34eee5ed4216c65b2.module.wasm

Functions:      1941
  Imported:       17
  Non-imported: 1924
  Exported:       19

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:       596
  Of those, unique functions:  596 (i.e., at least 30.71% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:    730169
  call:           19527 (2.67% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:    283 (0.04% of all, 1.43% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 1048576
      894 × global.get   1770 × global.set   2664 total (34/66% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:  894 (46.47% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
