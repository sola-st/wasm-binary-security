Functions:       636
  Imported:       23
  Non-imported:  613

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:       332
  Of those, unique functions:  253 (i.e., at least 39.78% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #3
Functions using stack pointer:  126 (20.55% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
