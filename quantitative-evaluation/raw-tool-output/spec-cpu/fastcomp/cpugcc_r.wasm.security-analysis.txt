Functions:      9525
  Imported:       45
  Non-imported: 9480

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:      6054
  Of those, unique functions: 3409 (i.e., at least 35.79% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     import: env.__table_base
         0 × global.get       0 × global.set       0 total
  #1 f64

      7765 × global.get   11581 × global.set   19346 total (40/60% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #3
Functions using stack pointer: 3724 (39.28% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
