Functions:      7915
  Imported:      110
  Non-imported: 7805

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:      12689
  Of those, unique functions: 5915 (i.e., at least 74.73% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #3
Functions using stack pointer: 3327 (42.63% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
