Functions:      3833
  Imported:       97

  Table entries at init:      5944
  Of those, unique functions: 2787 (i.e., at least 72.71% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #3
Functions using stack pointer: 1734 (46.41% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
