Functions:       551
  Imported:       21
  Non-imported:  530

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:       190
  Of those, unique functions:  129 (i.e., at least 23.41% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #3
Functions using stack pointer:  143 (26.98% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
