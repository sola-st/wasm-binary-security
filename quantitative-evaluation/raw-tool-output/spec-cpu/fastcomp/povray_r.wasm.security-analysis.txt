Functions:      1738
  Imported:       50
  Non-imported: 1688

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:      1290
  Of those, unique functions:  620 (i.e., at least 35.67% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #5
Functions using stack pointer:  727 (43.07% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
