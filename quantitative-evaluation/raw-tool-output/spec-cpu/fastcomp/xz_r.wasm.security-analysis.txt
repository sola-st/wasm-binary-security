Functions:       275
  Imported:       13
  Non-imported:  262

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:       156
  Of those, unique functions:  114 (i.e., at least 41.45% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Globals:

     import: env.__table_base
       0 × global.get     0 × global.set     0 total

     115 × global.get   192 × global.set   307 total (37/63% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #1
Functions using stack pointer:   57 (21.76% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
