Functions:      25524
  Imported:       99
  Non-imported: 25425

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:      41402
  Of those, unique functions: 17314 (i.e., at least 67.83% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #6
Functions using stack pointer: 6173 (24.28% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
