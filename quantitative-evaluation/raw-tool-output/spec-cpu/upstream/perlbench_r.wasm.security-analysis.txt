  binary:    perlbench_r.wasm

Functions:      2128
  Imported:       70
  Non-imported: 2058
  Exported:       23

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:       998
  Of those, unique functions:  980 (i.e., at least 46.05% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:    837796
  call:           26685 (3.19% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:    425 (0.05% of all, 1.57% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 5524816
      943 × global.get   1881 × global.set   2824 total (33/67% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:  944 (45.87% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
