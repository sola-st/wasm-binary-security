Functions:      1101
  Imported:       53
  Non-imported: 1048
  Exported:       34

Tables: 1 (should be 1 in Wasm v1)
  Table entries at init:       746
  Of those, unique functions:  600 (i.e., at least 54.50% of all functions can be called indirectly, because they are in the [indirect call] table)

Instructions:    118808
  call:            4981 (4.19% of all instructions)
  call_indirect:    263 (0.22% of all, 5.02% of all calls)

Globals:
  #0 i32
     init: i32.const 5304240
     351 × global.get   701 × global.set  1052 total (33/67% split)

Likely the stack pointer:       Global #0
Functions using stack pointer:  329 (31.39% of all non-imported functions)
Stack increments: (How many functions increment the stack pointer by how much? Can also handle multiple increments per function, that's why it is an array of increments.)
